# DenGrow Contracts

Smart contracts for the DenGrow on-chain plant NFT game.

## Know your Contract

To add new contracts, follow detailed instructions at [Add new Contract](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-add-contract).

> **NOTE**: To use this example with Clarinet inside [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so), you can open the terminal session inside VS code by navigating to File -> View -> Terminal.

## Test your Contract
